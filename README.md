SafeBot is a VirusTotal-powered bot designed to enhance security in Discord servers by analyzing URLs and files shared within the platform. It flags content as safe or malicious using reactions (emojis) and messages to notify users in the case of potential threats.

This is a free and open-source project built for non-commercial use, leveraging VirusTotal for supplementary threat intelligence to promote safer online interactions.

⚠️ Disclaimer: SafeBot is not a substitute for antivirus software. Users are strongly encouraged to use dedicated antivirus solutions for comprehensive protection.
